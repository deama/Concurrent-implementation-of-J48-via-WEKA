# Concurrent-implementation-of-J48-via-WEKA
This is a Concurrent Implementation of J48 via WEKA which I have attempted for my MSc project. I have successfully made it much faster than the original version.
If you require more information, such as how fast it runs in comparison to the original, or just techincal information, please view my dissertation.

Not all of the files have been included as github limits the size, this only has the source-code. If you want pre-compiled versions, and an alternative JCSP implementation, please visit my website:
